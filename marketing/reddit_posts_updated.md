### 标题
[Showcase] Subsentry - Help your users save $400/mo on duplicate subscriptions

### 正文

Hey r/SaaS community! 👋

I just launched **Subsentry**, a free tool that helps small businesses discover and consolidate duplicate software subscriptions.

**The Problem I Solved:**

70% of businesses unknowingly pay for duplicate subscriptions:
- 5 different Notion accounts across teams ($900/mo vs $500 enterprise plan)
- Multiple Slack instances ($15 × 3 = $45/mo)
- Zombie subscriptions from ex-employees and forgotten trials
- **Average monthly waste: $400**

**The Solution:**

Subsentry automatically identifies duplicates and shows savings:

✅ **Duplicate Detection** - Smart matching by price, billing cycle, and service
✅ **Savings Calculator** - See exactly how much you'll save monthly/yearly
✅ **Quick Actions** - One-click cancel or consolidate subscriptions
✅ **Modern UI** - Clean, intuitive dashboard (dark mode!)

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 16 (static export)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- GitHub Pages (free hosting)

**Demo:** https://raye-deng.github.io/subsentry/
**GitHub:** https://github.com/raye-deng/subsentry

**Business Plan:**
- **Phase 1 (Now):** Free, collecting feedback
- **Phase 2 (3 mo):** Freemium ($4.99/mo pro, $19.99/mo team)
- **Phase 3 (6 mo):** Scale to 500 paid users ($2.5k/mo)

**Feedback Wanted:**
1. Does this solve a real problem you've seen?
2. Pricing thoughts on the freemium model?
3. Marketing channels beyond Reddit?
4. Any technical improvements needed?

Thanks in advance for any feedback! 🙏

[Showcase] How I found a $4,800/year problem and solved it in 48 hours

### 正文

Hi r/Entrepreneur! 👋

I want to share my small journey from identifying a problem to launching a solution in 48 hours.

**The Discovery:**

A few months ago, while reviewing monthly expenses, I discovered I was paying for the same service twice (two different accounts). I started asking friends and colleagues, and found:
- 70% of people have at least one duplicate subscription
- Average monthly waste: $15-30
- Some people waste over $100/mo

**The Opportunity:**

Existing solutions have problems:
- Bank/credit card statements: Don't identify subscriptions, don't calculate duplicates
- Other subscription managers: Require manual input, no automatic duplicate detection, privacy concerns with bank auth

**The Gap:**
✅ Automatic duplicate subscription identification
✅ Clear savings calculation
✅ Simple action flow
✅ Privacy-friendly design

**The Build (48 hours):**

**Day 1:** Idea validation
- Research competitors
- Talk to potential users
- Confirm need exists

**Day 2:** Product development
- Design MVP features
- Build tech stack (Next.js + TypeScript)
- Implement core features

**Day 3:** Deploy and test
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Test features
- Prepare marketing materials

**The Product: Subsentry**

**Core features:**
1. 🔍 **Duplicate Detection** - Smart identify same price and billing cycle subscriptions
2. 💰 **Savings Calculator** - Real-time display of monthly/yearly savings
3. 🚀 **Quick Actions** - One-click cancel or merge duplicates
4. 📱 **Always Available** - Runs entirely in browser

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- GitHub Pages deployment
- **Dev time:** ~48 hours

**Demo:** https://raye-deng.github.io/subsentry/
**GitHub:** https://github.com/raye-deng/subsentry

**Business Plan:**

**Phase 1 (0-3 months):** User validation
- Goal: Collect feedback, optimize product
- Pricing: Completely free

**Phase 2 (3-6 months):** Freemium model
- Goal: 100 paid users, $500/mo
- Pricing:
  - Free: Basic features
  - Pro: $4.99/mo (auto bank sync, unlimited subs, history, budget)
  - Team: $19.99/mo (collaboration, permissions, reports, API)

**Phase 3 (6-12 months):** Scale
- Goal: 500 paid users, $2,500/mo

**Target Audience:**
1. Small business owners (2-20 team members)
2. Freelancers
3. Heavy SaaS users
4. Users wanting to optimize spending

**Success Metrics:**
- 24h: 100 visitors, 20 users add subs, 10 Reddit comments, 50 upvotes
- 1 week: 500 visitors, 100 users, 50 dupes found, 10 consolidate actions
- 1 month: 2000 visitors, 500 registered, 200 dupes, 50 consolidate, 10 GitHub stars

**Lessons Learned:**
**What I did right:**
✅ Validate need first, then build
✅ Fast MVP (48 hours)
✅ Choose right tech stack (Next.js deploys easy)
✅ Early user feedback

**What I could improve:**
❌ Should start marketing earlier
❌ Should prepare better screenshots/demos
❌ Should do more user interviews before coding

**Advice for new entrepreneurs:**
1. Start small, validate quickly
2. Don't over-design, MVP is enough
3. Listen to early user feedback
4. Choose familiar tech stack

Small business owners! You might be hiding duplicate subscription costs

### 正文

Hi small business owners! 👋

As a small business owner, I often find myself unknowingly purchasing duplicate subscription services—multiple team members buying the same SaaS tools, or forgetting to cancel free trials that auto-renew.

That's why I developed **Subsentry**.

**🎯 What is Subsentry?**

Subsentry is a free web tool that helps small business owners:

- **🔍 Auto-discover duplicate subscriptions** - Identify same price and billing cycle subscriptions
- **💰 Calculate savings** - Show monthly/yearly savings from consolidating
- **🚀 Quick actions** - One-click cancel or merge duplicate subscriptions
- **📱 Use anywhere** - Runs entirely in browser, no download/install needed

**💡 Real Scenario:**

> You have 3 team members, each bought Zoom Pro ($14.99/mo)
>
> You also bought 2 separate design tool subscriptions, each $29/mo
>
> You forgot to cancel a 3-month-old free trial, now charging $39/mo
>
> **With Subsentry, you can immediately discover these duplicates and save up to $113.97/month!**

**🆓 Completely Free**

Subsentry is in early testing phase, **completely free to use**. Advanced features may be added in the future, but basic duplicate detection will always be free.

**🔒 Privacy Protected**

- Your subscription data is saved locally in your browser only
- We don't upload or share your subscription information
